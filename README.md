# Visual_Inspection
Matlab Software Package to simplify Visual Inspection of Eye Tracking Data

download all the listed .m files and place them in your default matlab directory

run UBICOMP.m  and it will prompt you to select the files that you want to load. (this works on windows, I'm not sure it will run on mac(it should))

By default the program wall ask you to input sub plot layout, data column to plot etc. If you open UBICOMP.m you can change my_debug to true and it will let you preload all the values so matlab doesn't ask.
plot_eye_data.m lists all the plots available
